## About

Lets you run scripts in-game without using the editor or recompiling mods for debugging, developing and other shenanigans

### Features

* totally original name and ui (rip Synapse)
* syntax highlighting and codemap (I wish CodeEdit was a 3.5 node)
* built-in `PlayerAPI`, `KeybindsAPI` libraries and `localPlayer` variable
* customizable keybind to open and close the menu (Default F1)

## Requirements
* [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave)
* [BlueberryWolfi APIs](https://github.com/BlueberryWolf/APIs/tree/main)
